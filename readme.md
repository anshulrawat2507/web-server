## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-webserver.git
cd multithreaded-webserver
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/webserver.jar
```

## 💻 Usage

### Starting the Server

```java
WebServer server = new WebServer(8080);  // Default port 8080
server.start();
```

### Configuration Options

```java
// Custom thread pool size
server.setThreadPoolSize(10);

// Custom request queue size
server.setRequestQueueSize(100);

// Custom timeout settings
server.setTimeout(5000);  // milliseconds
```

## 🔍 Architecture Overview

### Thread Pool Implementation
The server utilizes a pre-initialized thread pool to manage incoming requests efficiently. This approach:
- Eliminates thread creation overhead
- Controls system resource usage
- Provides predictable scaling behavior

### Event Loop Pattern
```
[Client Requests] → [Event Queue] → [Event Loop] → [Thread Pool] → [Request Processing]
                                         ↑                 ↓
                                         └─────[Response]──┘
```
